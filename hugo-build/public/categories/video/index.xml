      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been my experience that with most new things you learn, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a gradual process, there&amp;rsquo;s a distinct moment when it all clicks. I can remember sitting on the couch running git commands from the terminal to revert my work and just marveling at how cool it felt.
That wore off pretty quickly, and after typing git status for the 16,423,325th time I decided I was ready to commit to some git aliases.</description>

A motion graphic piece I put together for the MFA Design &amp;amp; Technology Thesis show.
It outlines the four major steps in creating with the Toys of the Apocalypse world I created for my thesis while at Parsons.

      <title>Guinness Logo Animation</title>

      <description>In this assignment we were to choose any well known brand, and create a storyboard for an animation of their logo. While the first assignment had 30 seconds to establish a narrative, this assignment was constrained to 5. One of the particular qualities of a finely poured Guinness is the beautiful cascading effect that occurs due to the nitrogen bubbles. The method of pouring has such an affect on these nitrogen bubbles, and ultimately on the taste of the drink, that it has spawned competitions across the world to achieve the perfect pour.</description>

      <description>One of the main critiques in class last week was that the white background wasn’t the right feel for Guinness. They said the color scheme should be changed to the black and gold colors that are seen on the cans themselves. That also matches the beer itself, one of the features that makes Guinness so distinguishable from many other beers. I also decided to add a little flare that would run down the harp as the border lines faded in.</description>

As a part of a show exhibited at NYCAMS in New York City, I built a pair of boxes to mimic a Starbucks drive thru. The “order” box had a speaker and microphone installed that would playback a loop of ambient tones mixed with noise from the gallery floor. The “pickup” window had a TV installed that looped an animation made by myself and Amy Wilk.</description>
