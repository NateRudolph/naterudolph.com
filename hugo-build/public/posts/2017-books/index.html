    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve typically kept New Year&rsquo;s resolutions vague to free my late February conscious from the crushing weight of disappointment. But for whatever reason 2017 I decided to commit to reading at least one book a month. I think because it happened to coincide with a slow retreat from all forms of social media it has actually turned out to be pretty successful.</p>

&ldquo;Call of the Wild&rdquo;
When trying to kickstart a new habit I think it&rsquo;s helpful to make it easy on yourself. So for this I picked a book that&rsquo;s more likely to be on a middleschooler&rsquo;s summer reading list than career-minded adult with important crap to get done.</p>

&ldquo;The Tiger&rdquo;
Technically I &ldquo;listened&rdquo; to this one, which is probably a better idea than reading unless you&rsquo;re good at pronouncing Russian nouns in your head. It&rsquo;s half gripping narrative about a man hunting a tiger that&rsquo;s started to eat people, and half Russian history textbook.</p>

&ldquo;Heart of Darkness&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo;</p>
