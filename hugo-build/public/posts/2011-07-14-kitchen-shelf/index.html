<p>After moving to an amazing loft apartment in Brooklyn my roommates and I quickly discovered we needed a lot more storage space for the kitchen. As with any New York apartment, space was tight and there was really only one way to go: up.</p>

<p>I wanted something cheap, modular, and sturdy. That last one meant Ikea wasn’t an option, and anything we might have found at thrift stores on on the sidewalk wouldn’t fit our specific size requirements. I looked around online and found <a href="http://www.the-brick-house.com/2009/09/shelving-unit/">this project</a> and decided to copy the basic idea.</p>
