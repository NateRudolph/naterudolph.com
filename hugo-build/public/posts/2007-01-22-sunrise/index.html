    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>The sun is just now showing though the trees in the horizon. The fog, which only minutes before had blanketed the entire field, was beginning to melt as the orange and purple fingers widened in the east. The barn that sat on the border between the ground and the sky was originally a dark red. Now it faded to an orange in the new light.</p>

<p>Once a month or so I gather the will power to not hit snooze and make it out to our front porch and watch the show. Even during the summer itâ€™s usually cold enough to warrant a blanket. I fall out of bed still clutching my quilt and stumble on the wicker deck loveseat outside. The cold wind lightly hitting my face is the only thing that keeps my groaning body awake.</p>

<p>Every month a thousand reasons pop into my head why I should climb back into bed, how busy the day will be, how I need the rest. But one by one the voices are quieted with each stroke of the painting slowly revealing itself in the sky.</p>

<p>Of course things do have to be done today, people expect things from me; and even under my habitual morning apathy, I expect things from myself. But each time I wake up early and sit out on the porch I realize that losing an hour of sleep is always worth the witnessing the beauty that always goes on despite the absent audience. Though I may not be as well rested, I can realize the day is new, because I saw it being born. Rest traded for inspiration.</p>
