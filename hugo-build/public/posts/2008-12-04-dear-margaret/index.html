    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>The sun set through the windows creating long golden shadows on the couch and end table next to it. The room had several windows that let the only light in. Dust danced through the columns of fading light as Alvin walked toward the couch and eased his way into its faded cushions. When his full weight finally creaked into place a small cloud of dust rose to meet the dancing ones. He rested his notebook and pen on the empty seat. Alvin coughed.</p>

<p>He didn’t like the fluorescent ceiling lights on because they hurt his eyes so he often found himself in the couch to finish off the day at sunset. Sometimes he would read, sometimes he would just slowly fall asleep. He had a TV across from the couch, one of the old kinds that has the wooden frames. There was no remote and only two channels so Alvin used it more for a bookshelf than entertainment. All he could see in the thick concave glass was his own body starring back at him.</p>

<p>His white hair appeared blonde in the late sunlight, but there was nothing for the wrinkles. He squinted at the screen then looked down to his knee. A small patch of red covered his pants at the knee. Alvin quizzically looked up while rubbing his knee. He reached to the end table and scanned it with his hand. Coming up empty Alvin quickly stood up and surveyed the entire room. Suddenly remembering, he felt for his glasses hanging on a chain around his neck. He backed up to the couch and found the arm with his left hand and fell again into its dusty comfort.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Dear Margaret,</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for the glasses holders. I don’t lose them near as often as I used to. You always were into practical things for gifts. I remember one Christmas when all you asked for was a set of kitchen knives. I thought you were kidding and got you a new dress and some jewelry. Do you remember that year? I think you may have left the dress here. I’ll set it out for you if you want it.</em>
<em>I’m writing because the last few times you’ve stopped by I realize that I can never say the things that I wanted to. You know I’ve always been able to write better than talk.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Alvin peered over his glasses to the door next to the TV. He could hear faintly the sound of a car door shutting. As he set his notebook aside the car rumbled down the gravel driveway and onto the highway. Alvin opened the door, gently kicked the outer storm door with practiced grace and stopped to find a few grocery bags on the porch with a note.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Alvin, Sorry I couldn’t stay and talk this week. Don’t forget to put the chicken ones in the freezer. Also, the white bottle is a refill for the Zyprexa. -Margaret”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the kitchen Alvin emptied the bags onto the table. Each individual aluminum container was labeled with big letters in sharpie. Alvin tried to angle the tin and his glasses so he could see focus them. After a few unsuccessful seconds he placed it in the open refrigerator. He did the same with the rest and then popped one of the pills from into his mouth and swallowed. Alvin closed his eyes for a moment, standing in the quiet kitchen. It was just dark enough to make it hard to see now. He reached around the refrigerator to flip the lights on, and after peeking a look out the window, grabbed the shotgun on top of the cabinets and began loading it.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Dear Dr. Slichter,</em></p>

<p><em>When we last talked I suggested something you said would be ridiculous. I just believe it would be the best for our entire community. Last week a few boys on four wheelers were cutting through the Valley and Alvin almost killed them with his shotgun…</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Several hours later Alvin returned with the shotgun. He unloaded each of the shells and returned them and the gun to the top of the cabinet. After a yawn he reached into the silverware drawer and pulled out a small spiral notebook and opened it.</p>

<p>August 25. No attempts at infiltration. A white Toyota Camry pulled into driveway to turn around. Possibly a scout. 423-CZXK.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>…How are the Grant boys doing? Ed stopped coming by for coffee like he used to. The last time he came he told me I had shot at his boys and nearly killed one. I don’t think he liked it when I said his boys must have been making it up. I think he actually believes them.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The next morning a man in a suit hopped off his bike and threw the kickstand down as he cautiously surveyed the front porch. His hair was dark blonde, slicked down and professional. He never really smiled, but didn’t ever appear to be frowning. He grabbed a few flyers from his backpack and headed down the short sidewalk path to the front steps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Hold it.” The man, shocked, looked up to see a shadow at one of the windows.
“Um…hello?”
“Why don’t you just turn your federal ass right around and get out of town.”
“Federal?&hellip;Sir, I think you might be confu-”
“I know a fed when I see one, think I haven’t seen the movies? That’s a great suit but you’re missing the sunglasses.”
“How many of them ride bicycles sir?”
“…well you’d be the first I imagine. What’ve you got in that bag?”
“Just some literature. You’re welcome to it if you like.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The young man slowly placed his foot on the first step inching closer to the door. His arms extended towards the shadow behind the window with a book and a flyer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’d take your foot off that step if I were you.”
“I’d really just like to talk to you. If this isn’t a good time I can come back…”
“You won’t be doing much talking if you step on that step.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gently removed his foot and started to turn around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Now wait there son. I think I believe you. And I wouldn’t mind the company. How do you take your coffee?”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><em>The reason for this letter Margaret is that I realize what a mistake it was for you to leave the house. I could list the reasons you should come back but we both know them all. I see the way you smile when you stop by, the way you listen to my old stories on the porch. As if you’ve never even heard them. I know there’s been a lot to keep us apart, but I promise that nothing will come between us again, I will always protect you.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Several minutes later they both were on the rocking chairs, Alvin had left his shotgun inside but the young man saw him place it next to the door before he came out with two cups of black coffee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You have a lovely view here, I’m Rick by the way.”
“Thank you, Rick. Sorry about the scare there.” Alvin handed Rick the mug and leaned back into his chair, starting the steady beat of the porch and chair creakings.
“You made it sound like there was a landmine under that step&hellip;” 
“I never said there wasn’t.” Alvin interrupted. He glanced at Rick without turning his head forward and cautiously he took a sip from the coffee.
“…Well, is there something wrong with it? I’m pretty handy with a hammer.”
“I just wouldn’t touch the first step.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><em>Dear Dr. Slichter,</em></p>

<p><em>I understand your hesitancy to so drastically change Alvin’s environment but I think he’s proven that this situation will only get progressively worse and he obviously needs more attention than either of us can  offer. He’s becoming more and more unstable and I’m certain something will happen if we don’t take action.</em></p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>“Rick, I must say, they’re getting sloppy.”
“Excuse me?” Rick slowly placed the half empty coffee mug on the deck and started towards his backpack.
“They think they can send some greenhorn on a bike and fool the old man.”
“Sir I think it’d be easiest if I just left. I doubt you’ll do anything with them but you can have these.” Rick extended the flyers he had been clutching to and waited to make eye contact with Alvin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alvin looked up and took another sip from his coffee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“See, now that would be the easiest if it weren’t for the poison you just drank.”
“What?&hellip;”
“It’s slow acting but I can assure you there’s no antidote. Tell your superiors that whatever it is they want from me, they’re not going to get it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rick grabbed his backpack and jumped over all the steps down to sidewalk. When he had covered what he felt like was a safe distance on his bike he turned around to see the old man methodically walk down each step and place a letter in the mailbox.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Dear Margaret,</em></p>

<p><em>I have compiled your information and my findings and brought it before our board here at the hospital. Alvin’s Alzheimer’s has progressed rapidly during the past year. While his paranoia was originally a harmless eccentricity, the disease has progressed this case, as you suggested, into something more dangerous. His attributing your name to his late wife appears to be an attempt to sort out the confusion and find an ally amidst the swarm of his apparent ‘enemies’. We agree with you that his admittance to Lutheran Homes would be a suitable course of action.</em></p>
