    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>{% include vimeoPlayer.html id=&ldquo;37455050&rdquo; %}</p>

<p>The goal of Knuckledown is to be a tool that helps to calmly keep someone focused on the task at hand. Users are encouraged to break down one specific task, like writing a paper, into the various tasks that are inferred from the traditional one line on a To-Do list.</p>

<p>Influenced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyiâ€™s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>, the application can assist users in achieving a state of total immersion in a task by presenting only the current hurdle. This can also help to prevent the intimidation factor that can occur when looking at a comprehensive To-Do list and not knowing where to even start.</p>
