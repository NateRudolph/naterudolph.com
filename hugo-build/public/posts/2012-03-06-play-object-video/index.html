<p>The connections on the tiles need to be made more stable so you don’t have to hold it down to ensure it’s connected. Right now the top left washers cycle through the speed of the beat, and get reset to zero. Eventually I’d like to made it so the speed fluctuates up and down, but for now it’s still an easy way to lock into a speed you want to use.</p>

<p>The bottom two sets of washers have some older code on them right now that’s pretty boring sounding and I’ve just been using to test things out. Eventually they will allow you to set certain parameters over the beat being made.</p>

<p>To see the initial ideas/sketches check out the first entry.</p>
