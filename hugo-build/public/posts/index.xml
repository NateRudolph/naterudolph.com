      <title>Git Aliases</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been my experience that with most new things you learn, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a gradual process, there&amp;rsquo;s a distinct moment when it all clicks. I can remember sitting on the couch running git commands from the terminal to revert my work and just marveling at how cool it felt.
That wore off pretty quickly, and after typing git status for the 16,423,325th time I decided I was ready to commit to some git aliases.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve typically kept New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions vague to free my late February conscious from the crushing weight of disappointment. But for whatever reason 2017 I decided to commit to reading at least one book a month. I think because it happened to coincide with a slow retreat from all forms of social media it has actually turned out to be pretty successful.
&amp;ldquo;Call of the Wild&amp;rdquo; When trying to kickstart a new habit I think it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to make it easy on yourself.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working this weekend on mapping out all the technical aspects of the project so that I can keep tabs on my progress and foresee any major obstacles. At this point, I’m starting with the main interaction the editor will have: the hand-crank. Below is the basic workflow the machine will have from the hand-crank to the projector. I’ll be scouting out rotary encoders this week and starting to compile all the code needed to then attach to the video speed.</description>

I wrote some code in Arduino (adapted from code I found in a forum at: arduino.cc/​cgi-bin/​yabb2/​YaBB.pl?num=1241706282) that allows the user to turn a yellow LED on (by pressing Q) and off (by pressing W).
I tried to get A and S to work the other red LED but for some reason it wasn’t responding. Something to revisit. I didn’t realize until I got into things that the Arduino board isn’t actually always listening to the keyboard input like a Processing sketch would be.</description>

      <description>After some quick Googling, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find an end-to-end solution for creating a new Jekyll post from bash. My lack of experience in bash leads me to believe this isn&amp;rsquo;t the most succint solution but it works and is readable. Everything&amp;rsquo;s broken down into functions and kicked off at the end. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like in action.

The files were all uncompressed movs so I wanted a way to also convert everything to mp4 in one step.</description>

      <description>My brother created an amazing children’s story for his new daughter featuring a lovable storm cloud named Cloudgrave. When fall came around I knew exactly what I wanted to make for my new niece for her first Christmas, a stuffed animal version of the character to go along with story time.
In school I had been playing around with extremely small and low-power microcontrollers and I realized I could easily implant the center cloud portion with all the electronics necessary to make the lighting bolt glow.</description>

      <description>The sun set through the windows creating long golden shadows on the couch and end table next to it. The room had several windows that let the only light in. Dust danced through the columns of fading light as Alvin walked toward the couch and eased his way into its faded cushions. When his full weight finally creaked into place a small cloud of dust rose to meet the dancing ones.</description>

      <description>I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll soon forget this image before me. An entire mountain range of snow capped cliffs that seem to float over the dried up river valley. Hundreds of acres of sand and rock lie interrupted by the narrow channels that remind you that this once was, and will be again in its season, a gigantic river fed from the glaciers that rule over the land with a royal defiance. Every one of their peaks beg to be conquered, but the clouds that dance around them makes the plea futile, because I know I&amp;rsquo;ll never touch that snow or plant a flag there.</description>

Face tracking courtesy of Kyle McDonald I made a few adjustments to the default Processing sketch he included and wrote in a fairly reliable way to see whether or not the subject&amp;rsquo;s eyes are open. I then added that to a Processing game template found here
Then I combined the two sketches and reset the color of the blocks to make them invisible when the player&amp;rsquo;s eyes are open, and visible when they are closed.</description>

      <description>I work at a vineyard. And the answer is no, we don&amp;rsquo;t stomp on the grapes. To my knowledge that is a dead tradition. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked this numerous times, to which I always describe to my disappointed interviewer that we actually use an antique cedar press. Working at a vineyard seems to be a more interesting job than any old farm hand, but when it comes down to it, most of the work is the same.</description>

After grad school I was pretty sick of sitting behind a computer: writing papers, preparing presentations, waiting for renders. To remedy, I decided to build something completely analog. No arduino, no wiring or programming. The desk I had been using had gone through 3 moves from different apartments and was falling apart so I decided to build a new one. I knew I was going to be moving again so I wanted to build something sturdy, but easy to disassemble and pack.</description>

Fish Freedom is a mobile platform that allows a pet fish to control its movements across an environment. Using a webcam with blob detection software to provide navigation, two servomotors drive a vehicle that houses the fish tank and power supply.
The webcam provides a constant feed of where the fish is located in the tank and drives the fish in the appropriate direction, giving the fish the ability to decide the direction and speed of the vehicle’s movements.</description>

Ever since I opened up the Arduino Starter Kit I’ve wanted to figure out how to use the Flex Sensor. It seemed like such a unique way to interface with electronics and when I started doing some digging I saw that one of the very few examples of it in products was the old Nintendo Powerglove.
I’m looking forward to trying to make something a little more usable than the powerglove.</description>

I’ve made some pretty significant steps in the FlexSensor Glove since the last post. The LED is now mounted to the finger tip, and the cords are soldered and wrapped neatly coming out of the glove to keep things from getting shorted or confusing when hooking up to the Arduino.
The code itself also has added the video element. My main goal was to be able to virtually click and drag things with the glove using the webcam as a point of entry.</description>

      <description>In this assignment we were to choose any well known brand, and create a storyboard for an animation of their logo. While the first assignment had 30 seconds to establish a narrative, this assignment was constrained to 5. One of the particular qualities of a finely poured Guinness is the beautiful cascading effect that occurs due to the nitrogen bubbles. The method of pouring has such an affect on these nitrogen bubbles, and ultimately on the taste of the drink, that it has spawned competitions across the world to achieve the perfect pour.</description>

      <description>One of the main critiques in class last week was that the white background wasn’t the right feel for Guinness. They said the color scheme should be changed to the black and gold colors that are seen on the cans themselves. That also matches the beer itself, one of the features that makes Guinness so distinguishable from many other beers. I also decided to add a little flare that would run down the harp as the border lines faded in.</description>

While studying at Parsons I worked as a gallery technician at the award-winning Sheila Johnson Design Center. I helped build the exhibition and worked with the artists to ensure that the specific requirements were met for exhibiting their work. This included numerous video, sound, and interactive installations.

After moving to an amazing loft apartment in Brooklyn my roommates and I quickly discovered we needed a lot more storage space for the kitchen. As with any New York apartment, space was tight and there was really only one way to go: up.
I wanted something cheap, modular, and sturdy. That last one meant Ikea wasn’t an option, and anything we might have found at thrift stores on on the sidewalk wouldn’t fit our specific size requirements.</description>

Most mornings I have every intention on waking up and getting some work done before I go into school. To help remind me I&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes put a note on my alarm clock, but most mornings I can slam down on the snooze buttons with my eyes closed.
Some crazy alarm clocks that run off the nightstand, or explode into puzzle pieces, which does nothing to help remind you why you wanted to wake up a little earlier.</description>

The goal of Knuckledown is to be a tool that helps to calmly keep someone focused on the task at hand. Users are encouraged to break down one specific task, like writing a paper, into the various tasks that are inferred from the traditional one line on a To-Do list.
Influenced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow, the application can assist users in achieving a state of total immersion in a task by presenting only the current hurdle.</description>

After having spent countless hours trying to wrap my head around the mystery of arrays and classes and strings it was refreshing to feel something real in my hands. I was able to take it apart and understand the entire mechanism in a few minutes.

      <description>Imagine you’re walking into a class for the final exam. Everyone around you has been taking studying for the class for 6 years and will undoubtedly ace it. They laugh and engage in small talk as they lackadaisically sit for the exam. They even joke with the teacher as he passes out the test. When eyes fall on you however, the conversations are quieted or even silenced. They do so out of compassion, because everyone knows you haven’t studied, haven’t even been to the class.</description>

I had some leftover wood from another project and decided to try and make a quick pipe holder.
The red oak is such a hard wood it’s great for carving even if it takes a little bit longer most. It was helpful in this case because I wanted it to custom fit my favorite pipe and I could make very small changes with the dremel as I got closer and closer to the right fit.</description>

This week’s assignment for Major Studio was to create a ‘play object’ that had some sort of game or interactive experience, and included at least 4 buttons, 4 LEDs, and speaker output. My initial thought was to have a 3×3 board with tiles that could be rotated to complete different circuits, each tile space with 2 LEDs.</description>

The connections on the tiles need to be made more stable so you don’t have to hold it down to ensure it’s connected. Right now the top left washers cycle through the speed of the beat, and get reset to zero. Eventually I’d like to made it so the speed fluctuates up and down, but for now it’s still an easy way to lock into a speed you want to use.</description>

      <description>The dusty Arizona road reminded Ben of something from a sci-fi movie. Growing up he had always expected a UFO to appear from behind one of the giant stone arches. Most days he had hoped for it. The amber clouds reflected the last few minutes of the sun’s light across the dusty horizon.
 “God. This is beautiful,” Ben whispered, eyes locked on the road. “You didn’t have to come. They’ve got buses.</description>

This week has been an insane crash course in rotary encoders, Arduino and oF coding. I thought I had a handle on most of the simple types of circuits I would need for this project in Arduino, but working with serial communication between Arduino and oF proved to be quite the challenge. After some help from the amazing faculty at Parsons (we were emailing snippets of code from 2am – 4am…) we finally got things to start talking to each other.</description>

      <description>In college I bought a soldering iron and started taking all sorts of things apart and rewiring them. A very small percentage of those projects actually were finished, but it was always a fun experience. One such project was a small speaker cabinet I built to hang on the wall. The speakers were taken from a small toy keyboard and the wood from an old serving tray from Target.

For the past several weeks our Major Studio class has been exploring the “Zone of the Impending”, a section of the Translife exhibit hosted by MediartChina.
Taken from the Translife statement, Zone of the Impending, “…brings into focus concerns about ecosystems and environments upon which all life depends, calling attention to the plight of ecological disruption through creative inspirations via artists’ great imaginations and ingenious strategies to engage us actively in environmental protection and in the reconstitution of a healthy ecosphere, thereby advocating for a new consciousness of shared responsibility and citizen participation.</description>

      <description>The long country highway melted into the horizon. Windows down we could smell the hay as the wind ripped it from our hair, under our fingernails, down our shoes. Everything was golden. The dust in the air, the freshly cut fields, the sky and its ever-diminishing ruler. We drifted over the gentle hills in silence. We knew every rise and valley of this road. Every turn and pothole. The abrupt transition to gravel woke those sleeping, which was fine; it meant we were almost home.</description>

      <description>The sun is just now showing though the trees in the horizon. The fog, which only minutes before had blanketed the entire field, was beginning to melt as the orange and purple fingers widened in the east. The barn that sat on the border between the ground and the sky was originally a dark red. Now it faded to an orange in the new light.
Once a month or so I gather the will power to not hit snooze and make it out to our front porch and watch the show.</description>

      <description>In college I messed around quite a bit with Reason. I used it to create the soundtrack for Pact Lunch and a bunch of other little clips for various video projects. Most of those ideas came out of a creative challenge I gave myself. I had to wait until I was just about to fall asleep, and then fire up Reason and record any idea until I collapsed at my desk.</description>

      <description>Above all, Rudy was frugal. Which made him a rather lonely man. He worked from a desk in his kitchen, a locale that afforded all the amenities of any office building, without the necessity of a car: business card holder (for the unlikely drop in), name placard (for official-ness), a computer (for work), and a blender (for a cheap smoothie lunch).
Agatha, Rudy’s mother, was not as content with Rudy’s situation.</description>

      <description>The first time it happened on accident. Jackson wasn’t looking at the road and failed to avoid the gigantic puddle in front of the school. We were thrown from our seats when the bus thudded into the pothole and transformed from stupor to wonder as we watched the wave cascade over the windows.
Jackson would always hit the puddle after that day. The further back in the bus we sat the higher we flew, but some preferred to watch the water splatter against the tall windows in the front.</description>

      <description>Stan woke up with a bowl of half eaten cereal at his elbows.
 &amp;ldquo;You left that pizza in the oven last night.&amp;rdquo; Stan looked up to see a woman with frazzled hair wearing an oversized sweater.
&amp;ldquo;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten back early the whole building could have burnt down.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Sorry Jenny,&amp;rdquo; Stan replied. &amp;ldquo;I guess I fell asleep.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Of course you did. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you take the pills?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Just forgot I guess.</description>

      <description>Jack liked to make things. His bedroom floor was covered in broken alarm clocks, old remote controls, anything that was deemed “supplies” by Grandpa Flaherty. His latest project was a helmet that told the wearer the current weather. From each hole the in the rusty colander sprouted bunches of wires that lead to headphones attached at the handles.
 “Jack, get inside. It’s rai-” Grandpa Flaherty called from the porch.</description>

As a part of a show exhibited at NYCAMS in New York City, I built a pair of boxes to mimic a Starbucks drive thru. The “order” box had a speaker and microphone installed that would playback a loop of ambient tones mixed with noise from the gallery floor. The “pickup” window had a TV installed that looped an animation made by myself and Amy Wilk.</description>

      <description>I received my undergrad in what is called “Film Studies,” because a majority of the movies we watched and wrote about were shot on film. I also grew up in what will be the last generation to have seen a major motion picture premiere that was originally shot and edited on film. As I re-read Murch’s book, “In Blink of an Eye” this semester I was struck by how it knit together my previous education of film with my new path as a student of design and technology.</description>
