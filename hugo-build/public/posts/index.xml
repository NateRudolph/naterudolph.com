      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been my experience that with most new things you learn, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a gradual process, there&amp;rsquo;s a distinct moment when it all clicks. I can remember sitting on the couch running git commands from the terminal to revert my work and just marveling at how cool it felt.
That wore off pretty quickly, and after typing git status for the 16,423,325th time I decided I was ready to commit to some git aliases.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve typically kept New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions vague to free my late February conscious from the crushing weight of disappointment. But for whatever reason 2017 I decided to commit to reading at least one book a month. I think because it happened to coincide with a slow retreat from all forms of social media it has actually turned out to be pretty successful.
&amp;ldquo;Call of the Wild&amp;rdquo; When trying to kickstart a new habit I think it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to make it easy on yourself.</description>

      <description>Jack liked to make things. His bedroom floor was covered in broken alarm clocks, old remote controls, anything that was deemed “supplies” by Grandpa Flaherty. His latest project was a helmet that told the wearer the current weather. From each hole the in the rusty colander sprouted bunches of wires that lead to headphones attached at the handles.
 “Jack, get inside. It’s rai-” Grandpa Flaherty called from the porch.</description>

The files were all uncompressed movs so I wanted a way to also convert everything to mp4 in one step.</description>
