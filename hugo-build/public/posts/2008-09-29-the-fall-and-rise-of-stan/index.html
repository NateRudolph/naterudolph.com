    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>Stan woke up with a bowl of half eaten cereal at his elbows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You left that pizza in the oven last night.&rdquo; Stan looked up to see a woman with
frazzled hair wearing an oversized sweater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t gotten back early the whole building could have burnt down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry Jenny,&rdquo; Stan replied. &ldquo;I guess I fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did. Why didn&rsquo;t you take the pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just forgot I guess. I was working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was painting, Jenny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, at least Jackson gave you some money for cleaning the studio.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson was a painter too. Charisma didn&rsquo;t exude from him like a good politician, it would be better to say it fell off him in chunks. Large, awkward, and random chunks. When a joke was made he required it of himself to laugh the loudest. But when the scientologist in him took over he refused to laugh at all and instead pointed out the futility of humor in light of the world&rsquo;s misery. His short brittle hair formed a widow’s peak that peaked out a little less each year. Stan never saw him wearing anything other than V-neck t-shirts with random paint stains, and assumed that his closet contained nothing but. None of these things specifically made Jackson an douche-bag, but together it formed the perfect recipe.</p>

<p>Jackson was initially the reason Stan had wanted to move from their po-dunk hometown in Pennsylvania. He ran an art studio that invited young artists to learn under him. Stan had always admired Jackson&rsquo;s work and was ecstatic when he was accepted into Jackson&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking your bike.&rdquo; Jenny called from the door.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without waiting for confirmation she rolled the bike from its parking space next to the door. She carefully took a small cardboard box from a stack of boxes on the other side of the doorway and placed it in the cart of the bike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to take your pills.&rdquo; Jenny called out as the door slammed behind her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately Jenny was neither Stan&rsquo;s wife or girlfriend. Even sister would have been better than mother. After Stan&rsquo;s father left her, she was left with a house she couldn&rsquo;t afford payments on. Jenny primary source of income was marriage. Her secondary was selling incandescent light bulbs door to door. She was determined to convince everyone that incandescent bulbs were, &ldquo;&hellip;brighter, cheaper, smarter.&rdquo; Stan wasn&rsquo;t sure how some pyramid-scheming con man sold her 12 pallets of accidents waiting to happen, but he didn&rsquo;t ask too many questions because it made him feel vindicated in his own choice of work.</p>

<p>He rose from the table and walked to the counter where his morning drug cocktail awaited. As each pill slid down his throat he could feel his veins growing and heart quickening. The doctor told him his body would begin to become immune to them and he would eventually have to take more to stay awake. Stan&rsquo;s narcolepsy had been the reason he was fired, and given him the opportunity to experiment with even more drugs. As the doctors tried to discover exactly what kind he had, they gave him more and different kinds. Each seemed to enhance his senses in different ways. He could smell the oven-toasted goodness he created last night from the kitchen from the other side of the apartment but left it to get to work.</p>

<p>Stan had a busy day lined up. After today he wouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with a mother for a roommate and could ruminate on his work from a beach house in Maui. A mysterious international dealer was making the rounds and looking for a new artist to feature in his gallery. The details didn&rsquo;t matter to anyone. What mattered was someone was buying. Stan had heard he was going to Jackson&rsquo;s studio that afternoon and he planned on being there as well. Something that would be a tiny bit difficult as he was banned from the premise after an incident with a juicer and one of Jackson&rsquo;s paintings. Stan had called it a scintillating piece on deconstructionism in art. Jackson didn&rsquo;t have any words.</p>

<p>In his haste to remove from Stan from the studio Jackson had forgotten to take Stan&rsquo;s spare key. A key which he used to let himself in. Memories flooded over him as he stood in the doorway. For a brief moment he considered burning the place down. But he had come for a reason. A reason he had not yet completely thought out. The dealer would be here at some point, but he had to find a way to approach him and exhibit his work. He also needed to know what student&rsquo;s work had been selected by Jackson for ‘high honors&rsquo; so he could expose him. The same Google image search that Stan had found Jackson&rsquo;s work with he later found his own and realized that Jackson was taking student work, mixing it with a few of his own, and selling it mostly to dealers he knew would take it out of the country.</p>

<p>Stan had already planned his hiding spot and made his way past the front room to the storage closest. After climbing up one of the shelves to an air duct he quickly removed the cover and shimmied inside. Stan had always thought the large air ducts above the studio reminded him of the tubes from a McDonald&rsquo;s and was relieved to find that they were indeed secure enough to hold him.</p>

<p>From his vantage he could see the entire studio beneath him through the grate. The old wood floors were covered with splatters. Stan smiled when he saw the corner near the break room (that contained many food preparation items including a juicer) still had a particularly violent spill. He carefully positioned himself so his weight wasn&rsquo;t on the the grate. Then, he faded.</p>

<p>Several minutes later the class started to filter in and take their usual places behind the easels they had been working at. The last to enter was Jackson, wearing a particularly nice V-neck. Jackson had always considered it his &lsquo;dressy&rsquo; V-neck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Class, over the past few months I have taught you all that a human can about art. At this point you must understand that art has never been about human knowledge or technical skill. My prayers these past few months have been that I have taught you to listen to the voice of the thetans. Remember that you do not exist. There is no ownership of your body or even the work that it creates. It is only the result of constant meditation and communion with your thetan guide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson began hovering down the rows of students and examining their work. At this point in the semester those that didn&rsquo;t fully embrace Jackson&rsquo;s views had long since been removed. The ones that remained now affirmed his opening lecture and most had their eyes closed as they slowly put the finish touches on their final work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;May Xenu be praised.&rdquo; Jackson said softly as he returned to the head of the class. &ldquo;Many of you have achieved greatness here and it is my pleasure to announce that after class I will be accepting some of you for high honors. Please clean up your area before class is over so my spirit guide and I can perform the final selection process.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several hours later the class excitedly finished up their paintings are were escorted out. Jackson waited a few minutes and then began the transformation from classroom to personal gallery. One of the first lessons Jackson had taught was that signing a painting with ones name was a disgrace to the thetans that lived inside you.</p>

<p>This made it a very quick process of labeling each of them with his own signature.</p>

<p>The dealer came as expected and Jackson began his tour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You told me you had a lot of pieces but I never imagined one artist could create so much.&rdquo; The dealer said as he adjusted his white scarf to a more comfortable position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His accent and skin made Jackson assume he was some Middle Eastern oil prince.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I create for the people. It&rsquo;s easy to create so much when it is for the enjoyment and betterment of other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will still be asking for money?&rdquo; the dealer smirked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately the landlord does not share my philosophy&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not an issue. My father has been quite taken with American art lately and would be unhappy if I came back empty han-&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A loud creaking sound interrupted the dealer and he looked disapprovingly upward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe after today you&rsquo;ll have enough money to find your own building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I assure you this is some of the freshest and most original work you&rsquo;ll find here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson ushered the dealer to another easel to change the subject. He brought him over to one of Jackson&rsquo;s most talented students work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I think here you&rsquo;ll find the best example of&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson looked upward with his hand raised to emphasize his words. The last thing he saw was a sleeping body falling from the vaulted ceiling.</p>

<p>Stan woke up to find a shocked art dealer starring down at him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you have the time sir, I have some pieces I think you would be very interested in.”</p>
