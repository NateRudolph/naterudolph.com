<p>For the past several weeks our Major Studio class has been exploring the “Zone of the Impending”, a section of the Translife exhibit hosted by MediartChina.</p>

<p>Taken from the Translife statement, Zone of the Impending, “…brings into focus concerns about ecosystems and environments upon which all life depends, calling attention to the plight of ecological disruption through creative inspirations via artists’ great imaginations and ingenious strategies to engage us actively in environmental protection and in the reconstitution of a healthy ecosphere, thereby advocating for a new consciousness of shared responsibility and citizen participation.”</p>

<p>We were assigned to come up with personal responses to this idea. Anything from gallery pieces that call attention to these factors to practical solutions to problems of waste, pollution, consumption, etc. After breaking into groups of 3 we chose one idea as a group to develop over the course of two weeks.</p>

<p>Myself and my group members Conor Russomanno and Jason Moran, began work on a board game that we would eventually dub, “Squares of the Impending”</p>

<p>The game came out of dozens of conversations between our group, covering what philosophical realizations we wanted the user to come away with, the actual game mechanics, and the overall look and feel of the game itself. Though there are a number of game mechanic elements that need to be ironed out through another phase of game testing, the current experience of the game follows almost exactly to what we had intended. Players build out their developments with abstract pieces, while being forced to lay down rough tiles that are unusable. Eventually the end of the board is reached, but the rough tiles continue to be placed, causing an inward collapse of the board and the players pieces. Initially there is a strong sense of competition to obtain as much space as possible, but as players cut off their own section of the board they realize quickly that they are now competing against this inward movement, one that they created themselves.</p>
