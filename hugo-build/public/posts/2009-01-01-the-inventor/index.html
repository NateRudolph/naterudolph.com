    <h1 class="single-page__title">The Inventor</h1>
    <h2>March 4, 2009</h2>
    <p>Jack liked to make things. His bedroom floor was covered in broken alarm clocks, old remote controls, anything that was deemed “supplies” by Grandpa Flaherty. His latest project was a helmet that told the wearer the current weather. From each hole the in the rusty colander sprouted bunches of wires that lead to headphones attached at the handles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Jack, get inside. It’s rai-” Grandpa Flaherty called from the porch.</p>

<p>“No don’t tell me!” Jack said, holding his cupped hands to the headphones. “I’ll come in a sec, I’m just trying to get some control data.” Jack clenched his eyes closed, waiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grandpa Flaherty had taught Jack all about control data and hypothesizes and science. He was a real inventor: a drill that could cut through iron deposits underwater. Jack had brought a miniature of it last year, but was determined to have something original for this year’s show and tell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This rain is going to fry your circuits Jack. Come on, your mac and cheese is getting cold,” Grandpa Flaherty said. Jack opened his eyes to see him walk inside and shut the door.</p>

<p>“That idiot will never make anything but a mess,” Jack heard. He spun quickly but found no one around him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jack knew that some of the best inventions were stumbled upon; it stood to reason that a mind-reading machine would be one of those. He knew he had to repeat his results before he could publicize his findings. He ran inside, straight to the bathroom, and starred at the mirror. After a few seconds of concentration he closed his eyes and heard the voice inside his head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You… Are an inventor.”</p>
</blockquote>
