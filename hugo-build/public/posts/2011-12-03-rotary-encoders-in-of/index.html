<p>This week has been an insane crash course in rotary encoders, Arduino and oF coding. I thought I had a handle on most of the simple types of circuits I would need for this project in Arduino, but working with serial communication between Arduino and oF proved to be quite the challenge. After some help from the amazing faculty at Parsons (we were emailing snippets of code from 2am – 4am…) we finally got things to start talking to each other.</p>

<p>The rotary encoder is an interesting beast when it comes to circuits. I’m definitely still learning more about it as I go along, but it’s surprising how accurate the results are even in these early stages.</p>

<p>I also got some help from the great oF forum, which I’ll <a href="http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/reading-serial-data-from-arduino/8161/4">link here</a> for any interested in seeing the source code I ended up with.</p>
