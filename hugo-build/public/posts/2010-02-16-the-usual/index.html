<p>As a part of a show exhibited at NYCAMS in New York City, I built a pair of boxes to mimic a Starbucks drive thru. The “order” box had a speaker and microphone installed that would playback a loop of ambient tones mixed with noise from the gallery floor. The “pickup” window had a TV installed that looped an animation made by myself and Amy Wilk. Because the budget for the installation was exactly zero dollars, everything (even the TV) was either found or built using materials taken directly from the streets.</p>
