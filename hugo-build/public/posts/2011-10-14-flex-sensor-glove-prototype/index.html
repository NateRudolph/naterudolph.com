<p>Ever since I opened up the Arduino Starter Kit I’ve wanted to figure out how to use the Flex Sensor. It seemed like such a unique way to interface with electronics and when I started doing some digging I saw that one of the very few examples of it in products was the old Nintendo Powerglove.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to trying to make something a little more usable than the powerglove. (“I love the powerglove…It’s so bad!”) At the moment the flex sensor reads values and is programed to turn the LED on or off.</p>

<p>In the future I’d like to mount the LED to the finger itself, and then use a color motion tracking program to read from a webcam. The user will then be able to, in a sense, click and drag things using just their hands.</p>
