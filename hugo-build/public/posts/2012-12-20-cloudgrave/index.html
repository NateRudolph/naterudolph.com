    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>My brother created an amazing children’s story for his new daughter featuring a lovable storm cloud named Cloudgrave. When fall came around I knew exactly what I wanted to make for my new niece for her first Christmas, a stuffed animal version of the character to go along with story time.</p>

<p>In school I had been playing around with extremely small and low-power microcontrollers and I realized I could easily implant the center cloud portion with all the electronics necessary to make the lighting bolt glow. I wrote a simple program that generates a realistic flashing sequence that’s randomized each time the button is held down. I hot glued everything together and used some scrap cardboard to give the button a wide base so the bolt would light no matter where you pressed the cloud.</p>

<p>(Don’t worry! I trimmed all the LED legs and hot glued everything so nothing could poke little Sophie.)</p>
