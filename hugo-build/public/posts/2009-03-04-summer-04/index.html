    <h2>January 1, 0001</h2>
    <p>The long country highway melted into the horizon. Windows down we could smell the hay as the wind ripped it from our hair, under our fingernails, down our shoes. Everything was golden. The dust in the air, the freshly cut fields, the sky and its ever-diminishing ruler. We drifted over the gentle hills in silence. We knew every rise and valley of this road. Every turn and pothole. The abrupt transition to gravel woke those sleeping, which was fine; it meant we were almost home. The driver, whoever had lost the bet after work, would speed up to outrun the cloud of light gray smoke rising off the rocks.</p>

<p>Our plan didn’t need any communication or deliberation; it would be the same as yesterday, the day before, and probably tomorrow. We shook the day’s debris from tired limbs and headed inside. The house was always clean and quiet when we entered. The breeze that calmly wafted through the open windows was appreciated by our sweat-soaked bodies, but its tranquility was rarely given the respect it deserved. It was summer and we weren’t looking for tranquility.</p>

<p>The cabinets were raided, the fridge scavenged for recent leftovers, the lucky one who had remembered to call dibs on the shower took his turn replacing the stench of the earth with a fresh coat of Irish Spring. After we had each donned our new scent we headed to the garage to make preparations. Only the absolute essentials were packed into the rusty red wagon: 4 pounds of steak, 3 armfuls of wood, matches, a metal spatula, and the bodies of whoever hadn’t called dibs on driving the tractor that would haul everything.</p>

<p>Without fail the half-mile journey across the front lawn, which served equal parts lawn and alfalfa field, would result in the loss of at least two items from the wagon. Typically it would be a log preciously placed towards the back. By the end of the summer the field was a minefield of logs we had continually forgotten to pick up. As soon as we arrived to the shore of the pond we would set about the task of coaxing a new life from our thawing meat. A fire was made by whoever called dibs on the lighter.</p>
