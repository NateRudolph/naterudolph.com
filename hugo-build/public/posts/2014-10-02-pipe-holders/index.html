<p>I had some leftover wood from another project and decided to try and make a quick pipe holder.</p>

<p>The red oak is such a hard wood itâ€™s great for carving even if it takes a little bit longer most. It was helpful in this case because I wanted it to custom fit my favorite pipe and I could make very small changes with the dremel as I got closer and closer to the right fit. After roughing up the edges a bit and some stain the project was finished, just around a couple hours total.</p>
