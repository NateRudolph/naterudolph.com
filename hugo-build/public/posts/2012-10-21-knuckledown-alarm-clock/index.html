<p>Most mornings I have every intention on waking up and getting some work done before I go into school. To help remind me I&rsquo;ll sometimes put a note on my alarm clock, but most mornings I can slam down on the snooze buttons with my eyes closed.</p>

<p>Some crazy alarm clocks that run off the nightstand, or explode into puzzle pieces, which does nothing to help remind you why you wanted to wake up a little earlier. To help solve this problem, I&rsquo;ve put together my second edition to the Knuckledown suite, the Alarm Clock.</p>

<p>The alarm clock takes a word, phrase, or sentence, and uses that as your passcode for the next morning. When the buzzing alarm wakes you up, you are forced to say out loud the encouraging phrase or impending task you had from the night prior. Once the software takes in your speech the alarm sound is silenced.</p>

<p>The program was written in Processing and will be available for download on my website in a few weeks.</p>
