Imagine you’re walking into a class for the final exam. Everyone around you has been taking studying for the class for 6 years and will undoubtedly ace it. They laugh and engage in small talk as they lackadaisically sit for the exam. They even joke with the teacher as he passes out the test. When eyes fall on you however, the conversations are quieted or even silenced. They do so out of compassion, because everyone knows you haven’t studied, haven’t even been to the class. Some glare and snicker, some avoid any sort of contact. Perhaps out of superstition, more likely out of complete disregard. They will ace it. You will fail. Plus, you’re naked. You are an intern.

A bit of an exaggeration, but when I first stepped onto the Screen Gems lot I definitely had those feelings. Looking back on the experience as a whole I can appreciate the growth from that point to feeling perfectly comfortable on the set: talking with the crew, performing my duties, and navigating through the maze of equipment and celebrities. Amazingly, this was able to happen within only a few months.

That learning curve was made much more manageable by the help of a former classmate of mine who had gone through the same internship and now worked as a fulltime production assistant (PA). The first day I was overwhelmed with names, different things to get before shooting started, and where to stand or not stand, and the kinds of things that might be asked of me. After the initial rush of information we settled into what I would discover was a typical day of interning.

We stood outside the huge studio walls with a box controlling the lights and bells inside signifying the rehearsals and cuts for the action inside. For the first few weeks I felt chained to the box whenever it was assigned me. It seemed like at any moment I would be called on the walkie talkie to flip a switch and if I wasn’t there I would instantly be fired. Fortunately, one of the first things I learned about shooting a TV series came through hearing the chatter and interpreting it.

As the fourteen hour day progressed and I had only moved from my post two or three times I learned something: more than anything I learned that PAs must have comfortable shoes and a good rain coat.

I leave my experience with One Tree Hill knowing much more about the functions of different crew members, the importance of keeping things efficient, and the knowledge that I don’t want to take the PA track up the Hollywood corporate ladder. It was inspiring to hear the frustrations of so many crew members who are working hard to climb one more rung up the ladder, and I obviously appreciate the level of professionalism that comes with having so many talented people and nice equipment. However, I don’t see that as the track for my own production of films. With technology giving us so many opportunities to tell stories with a cheap camera and barebones crew, I’ve realized that’s much simpler than dedicating my life to watching doors for the next three years. As a senior looking for jobs I also understand passion to tell stories doesn’t exactly put food on the table, but the skills I’ve learned at One Tree Hill will definitely help in whatever projects I decide to undertake myself.
