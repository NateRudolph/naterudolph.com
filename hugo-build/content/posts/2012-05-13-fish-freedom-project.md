Fish Freedom is a mobile platform that allows a pet fish to control its movements across an environment. Using a webcam with blob detection software to provide navigation, two servomotors drive a vehicle that houses the fish tank and power supply.

The webcam provides a constant feed of where the fish is located in the tank and drives the fish in the appropriate direction, giving the fish the ability to decide the direction and speed of the vehicleâ€™s movements.
