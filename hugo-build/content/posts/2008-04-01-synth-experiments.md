In college I messed around quite a bit with [Reason](https://www.propellerheads.se/reason). I used it to create the soundtrack for [Pact Lunch]({{ site.baseurl }}/pact-lunch-soundtrack) and a bunch of other little clips for various video projects. Most of those ideas came out of a creative challenge I gave myself. I had to wait until I was just about to fall asleep, and then fire up Reason and record any idea until I collapsed at my desk.

Three of the tracks I'm most proud of from that period attached here:
