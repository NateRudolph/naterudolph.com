I’ve been working this weekend on mapping out all the technical aspects of the project so that I can keep tabs on my progress and foresee any major obstacles. At this point, I’m starting with the main interaction the editor will have: the hand-crank. Below is the basic workflow the machine will have from the hand-crank to the projector. I’ll be scouting out rotary encoders this week and starting to compile all the code needed to then attach to the video speed.
