Fantis Food is a food retailer specializing in Greek-centered markets. Their team requested a website mockup that built off the legacy of the nearly 100-year old brand. Many of the recipes had been handed down for generations so the site needed to convey an heirloom quality. The mockup given to them featured multiple designs for both mobile and desktop. Also included were several animations to help illustrate various interactions.
