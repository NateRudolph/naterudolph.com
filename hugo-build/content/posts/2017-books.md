I've typically kept New Year's resolutions vague to free my late February conscious from the crushing weight of disappointment. But for whatever reason 2017 I decided to commit to reading at least one book a month. I think because it happened to coincide with a slow retreat from all forms of social media it has actually turned out to be pretty successful.

# Call of the Wild
When trying to kickstart a new habit I think it's helpful to make it easy on yourself. So for this I picked a book that's more likely to be on a middleschooler's summer reading list than career-minded adult with important crap to get done.

# The Tiger
Technically I "listened" to this one, which is probably a better idea than reading unless you're good at pronouncing Russian nouns in your head. It's half gripping narrative about a man hunting a tiger that's started to eat people, and half Russian history textbook.

"Heart of Darkness"

"Deep Work"

"Gunslinger"
