In college I bought a soldering iron and started taking all sorts of things apart and rewiring them. A very small percentage of those projects actually were finished, but it was always a fun experience. One such project was a small speaker cabinet I built to hang on the wall. The speakers were taken from a small toy keyboard and the wood from an old serving tray from Target.
