The goal of Knuckledown is to be a tool that helps to calmly keep someone focused on the task at hand. Users are encouraged to break down one specific task, like writing a paper, into the various tasks that are inferred from the traditional one line on a To-Do list.

Influenced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyiâ€™s concept of [flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>), the application can assist users in achieving a state of total immersion in a task by presenting only the current hurdle. This can also help to prevent the intimidation factor that can occur when looking at a comprehensive To-Do list and not knowing where to even start.
