I work at a vineyard. And the answer is no, we don't stomp on the grapes. To my knowledge that is a dead tradition. I've been asked this numerous times, to which I always describe to my disappointed interviewer that we actually use an antique cedar press. Working at a vineyard seems to be a more interesting job than any old farm hand, but when it comes down to it, most of the work is the same. I've been both before, but no one wants to hear about baling hay.

Despite this similarity in work, there is certainly something special about this vineyard, in particular its owner: Charles Gardener Cash. Mr. Cash is a Vietnam Vet, he worked on helicopters and would, if you showed the slightest bit of interest, gladly explain to you the inner workings of any mechanical item within sight. Upon his return to the states he became a professional actor, still is a member of the Screen Actor's Guild. And though his 6 foot, 250 pound body certainly doesn't look limber, he has a black belt in taeknowdo.

But the man is first and foremost a farmer. He could plant a bolt in his yard and have a hardware store pop up the next year. Something that wouldn't seem out of place in a yard strewn with broken down sheds, tractor parts, old trailers, and the fusion of those parts into various inventions. Maybe it comes with a middle name like Gardener.

During the winter and spring months, when there's no work at the vineyard, we go through that yard, cleaning, organizing, building. I continually wonder over the years if it will ever end. After a full days work of going through old boxes and moving dead machinery around, one small corner reveals the bare earth underneath. But we both know the next project will consume that space and leave it as before.

One such project was leveling out a small section of land in preparation for a new building. We were interrupted by the blood curdling scream of Mrs. Cash, followed by the frantic barking of their small Jack Russell.

> "CHAAAARLESS! CHARLES COME HERE!"

Mr. Cash looked up and began to walk back towards the house where she had been raking some leaves. I followed, shovel in hand, observing that the speed at which Mr. Cash was walking did not live up to the intensity to which Mrs. Cash was screaming. He must know what's going on.

When we arrived to the house Mrs. Cash had already retreated inside, but the dog's barking lead us to the source. A large snake was curled up, hissing in defense at the dog who was equally as scarred. Yes! I'm gonna to rock this snake's world. I walked closer as Mr. Cash shoo-ed the dog away and looked down at the creature. We paused for a moment, me wondering if I should try and cut it in half with the edge of the shovel, or just crush the head; Mr. Cash apparently wondering if the snake was about to strike at something; and the snake probably wondering what the crap it was going to do pinned against the house and two giants.

After a few seconds, he reached out his hand and asked for the shovel. What? No! ...I wanna do this. Get your own shovel and maybe I'll let you bury him or something. Willingly, but disappointed, I handed him the shovel. I stepped back and prepared to see him take my kill.

To my amazement, he gingerly scooped up the beast and carefully moved him under the house. It then slithered into the darkness of the concrete crawl space. He handed me back the shovel and walked away. I followed, confused. I couldn't even think of a question that one might ask after something like that.

> "That's Ralph." he said as we returned to our work. "Ralph and I have a little deal"

I had trouble stifling a chuckle, I contained it to a smile and let him continue.

> "Ya see, Ralph isn't poisonous. He just eats other snakes. So I let him live under the house, and he eats all the other snakes." He explained to me as if negotiating a deal with snake was fairly commonplace.

> "And what's Mrs. Cash think of this arrangement?"

> "Weeeell...I've never actually told her I killed him. I guess she thinks I kill Ralph 'bout once a year." He smiled and we quietly went back to shoveling dirt.

When the summer months come the real work begins. Everyday we travel down the road to the vineyard and spend the daylight working around the few acres of vines. We prune, and we plant, water, and weed; all under the back breaking heat of July and August's relentless sun. All the while he talks of his dreams for the place.

> "I'm thinkin' bout puttin' up a water tower up there by the eatin' grapes."

The eating grapes are the kind you buy at the store, he'd explained to me. (Pronounced EA-tin, and with as much southern accent as possible) Ironically, he knows the scientific names for all the varieties in the vineyard, but chooses to use the common vernacular.

> "You think that's a good place?"

> "Yea, it's got that hill...The water'd just run right down."

Of course he didn't have to ask me. While my knowledge consisted of gravity and its effects on water he went on to explain to me the complex irrigation system he had already thought out, even down to the PVC pipe model of a pump he had designed. I think he asks me just to make sure he's thought out his own plans. I have yet to add something truly insightful to his numerous questions, but he always seems glad to have asked.

Mr. Cash's life is one of balanced contrasts. While most people seem to live in the world, he lives with it. He toils over the ground and it returns his efforts with work of it's own, giving whatever he asks of it. He lives the life of a farmer, yet has seemed to have lived several other entire lives. Though he could tell you the physics behind the underground irrigation system, he prunes the vines with the contemplative movements of a Renaissance sculptor. So even though we don't stomp on any grapes, there's still plenty of interesting things at the vineyard.
