Above all, Rudy was frugal. Which made him a rather lonely man. He worked from a desk in his kitchen, a locale that afforded all the amenities of any office building, without the necessity of a car: business card holder (for the unlikely drop in), name placard (for official-ness), a computer (for work), and a blender (for a cheap smoothie lunch).

Agatha, Rudy’s mother, was not as content with Rudy’s situation. The more Agatha felt like a grandmother the more she realized she might never become one. This caused her, a month ago, to do something that would change Rudy’s life forever.

On this particular day however, Rudy spent most of the afternoon cutting out coupons before braving the journey to the grocery store. His errand was precise: one can of whole kernel corn, one bag of tossed salad, and two pounds of New York strip (buy one get one free). Rudy wasn’t typically a steak eater, but the magnitude of the deal and the importance of the meal led him to grudgingly purchase the top dollar meat.

Rudy was nervous. FindYourMate.com encouraged its members to use restaurants or parks for first dates, but Rudy had convinced Molly he wasn’t a rapist, and she had agreed to come over. Rudy had begun to notice that potential suitors were unimpressed with his lacking a car, due to their lack of further communication, so he was determined to forgo that bit of information as long as possible. This left Molly as the final hope for Agatha to ever see baby Montgomeries.

Molly was the fourth match for Rudy by FindYourMate. According to science, they were perfect for each other in exactly 37 ways. This kind of extensive research was an expense that the website passed down to its users in the form of a $14 dollar monthly fee. Had Agatha not borrowed Rudy’s credit card and signed him up, Rudy would never have considered such a frivolous expense. For better or worse (for richer or poorer), the contract had been made. Rudy was forced to find a loophole.

Love not being a thing Rudy was quite familiar with, the 4 free matches seemed statistically viable for finding a wife. With the final match sitting across the table, at his apartment, the situation was becoming more and more clear. Rudy was awkward, and Molly was beautiful.

> “This is a gorgeous table cloth,” Molly said, stroking it as she lifted her glass.

> “My mother made it,” Rudy sawed through his steak intently and muttered to his plate, “but thank you.”

> “Hm?” Molly tilted her head still swallowing.

> “The compliment. I’ll be sure to tell her you liked it.” Rudy looked up to see Molly smiling. The room bounced with the energy coming from her slightly cracked lips.

> “Is this…Is this table… also your desk?”

> “Yes. I work from home,” Rudy said. He nervously shoved the last piece of meat into his mouth, which was far too big. Molly missed his arduous chewing as she took a final sip from her glass.

> “That’s very smart. You save a lot of money not having a car.” Molly sat her glass down and looked up with the same gripping smile.

> “It’s a beautiful night,” Rudy let out after finally swallowing. “Would you like to go for a walk?”
