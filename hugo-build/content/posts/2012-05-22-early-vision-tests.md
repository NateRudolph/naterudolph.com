Face tracking courtesy of [Kyle McDonald](http://github.com/kylemcdonald/FaceOSC-Templates)
I made a few adjustments to the default Processing sketch he included and wrote in a fairly reliable way to see whether or not the subject's eyes are open. I then added that to a Processing game template [found here](http://openprocessing.org/sketch/17115)

Then I combined the two sketches and reset the color of the blocks to make them invisible when the player's eyes are open, and visible when they are closed. There is a split second delay between the two stages which allows the player to only catch of glimpse of the next few sections.
This is simply a test to see the viability of this idea in gaming. Eventually I would like to apply it to a 3rd person gaming platform.
