mCoach was a tasking from Proficient Learning, an eLearning company that writes and produces training for a variety of national clients. After spending thousands of dollars each year to send their instructors around the country they needed a way to distribute their content online.

One of the main goals was to have high levels of interactivity and collaboration between any given instructor and her students. There also needed to be a way to archive the notes and conversations of all the users. 

A visual mockup was created with a video demonstrating both the proposed interactivity and a mock course.
