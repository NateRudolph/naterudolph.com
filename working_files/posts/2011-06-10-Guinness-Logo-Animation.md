In this assignment we were to choose any well known brand, and create a storyboard for an animation of their logo. While the first assignment had 30 seconds to establish a narrative, this assignment was constrained to 5. One of the particular qualities of a finely poured Guinness is the beautiful cascading effect that occurs due to the nitrogen bubbles. The method of pouring has such an affect on these nitrogen bubbles, and ultimately on the taste of the drink, that it has spawned competitions across the world to achieve the perfect pour. In my first iteration I wanted the logo animation to celebrate this uniqueness by drawing the logo itself out of the foam.
