Ever since I opened up the Arduino Starter Kit I’ve wanted to figure out how to use the Flex Sensor. It seemed like such a unique way to interface with electronics and when I started doing some digging I saw that one of the very few examples of it in products was the old Nintendo Powerglove.

I’m looking forward to trying to make something a little more usable than the powerglove. (“I love the powerglove…It’s so bad!”) At the moment the flex sensor reads values and is programed to turn the LED on or off.

In the future I’d like to mount the LED to the finger itself, and then use a color motion tracking program to read from a webcam. The user will then be able to, in a sense, click and drag things using just their hands.
