After grad school I was pretty sick of sitting behind a computer: writing papers, preparing presentations, waiting for renders. To remedy, I decided to build something completely analog. No arduino, no wiring or programming. The desk I had been using had gone through 3 moves from different apartments and was falling apart so I decided to build a new one. I knew I was going to be moving again so I wanted to build something sturdy, but easy to disassemble and pack.

I looked at dozens of different farmhouse tables online but nothing fit exactly what I was looking for. I ended up just sketching out a few different designs from the dimensions off my old desk and going with this. It’s still a work in progress, lots of sanding to be done and I’d like to lightly stain it a touch darker.

It’s about three times as heavy and overly supported as would be required for the weight it will hold, but I love the look and feel.
